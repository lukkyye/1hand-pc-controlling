<h1>1hand-pc-controlling</h1>

This proyect allows you to launch some pc processes with your hands, try some "mantra" signs to test some.
Probably, I will remove mouse emulation later.
(new features and things, soon)

<h2>Cython branch (Removed)</h2>
I tried using Cython but didn't see any difference from running normal Python. Maybe many dependencies are bothering.
